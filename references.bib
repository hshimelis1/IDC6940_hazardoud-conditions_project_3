  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards
               (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a
               constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We
               emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading
               conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is
               particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups.
               METHODS: We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic
               factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer
               with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node
               involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of
               hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered.
               RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed
               metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all
               factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic
               factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH
               assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model.
               Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but although
               its effect diminished over time, it remained strong.
               Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show any
               significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided strong
               evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect over time.
               Negative HRec status increased the risk of metastases early but
               became protective thereafter. This reversal of effect may
               explain non-significant hazard ratios provided by previous
               conventional Cox analyses in studies with long follow-ups.
               CONCLUSIONS: Investigating time-varying effects should be an
               integral part of Cox survival analyses. Detecting and accounting
               for time-varying effects provide insights on some specific time
               patterns, and on valuable biological information that could be

  abstract  = "AbstractSurvival analysis is concerned with studying the time
               between entry to a study and a subsequent event (such as death).
               Survival times now often refer to the development of a
               particular symptom or to relapse after remission of a disease,
               as well as to the time to death. A Cox regression model is a
               statistical technique for exploring the relationship between the
               survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. A Cox
               regression model provides an estimate of the treatment effect on
               survival after adjustment for other explanatory variables. Also,
               it allows us to estimate the hazard or risk of death for an
               individual given their prognostic variables. A Cox regression
               model must be fitted using an appropriate computer program (such
               as R, S‐Plus, SAS, STATA, or SPSS). The final model from a Cox
               regression analysis yields an equation for the hazard as a
               function of several explanatory variables. Interpreting the Cox
               regression model involves examining the coefficients for each
               explanatory variable. A positive regression coefficient sign for
               an explanatory variable means that the hazard is higher and thus
               the prognosis worse. Conversely, a negative regression
               coefficient implies a worse prognosis for patients with higher
               values of that variable. WIREs Comput Stat 2012, 4:310--315.

               on female breast cancer incident during 2004-2005 in the area of
               the Tuscan Cancer Registry, distinguishing them in five
               subtypes, according to ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 expression:
               luminal A, luminal B, luminal B/HER2 + , triple-negative, and
               HER2 + . Effects of subtypes and age on 10 years breast cancer
               specific survival were analysed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate
               Cox analysis. RESULTS: The majority of breast cancer were
               luminal B (57\%), and 45\% of them were diagnosed at
               pathological stage I. The 10-year survival rates (p < 0.001)
               were higher among luminal A (90.2\%) and lower among HER-2 +
               patients (70.3\%). Prognostic effect of age was statistically
               significant (p < 0.0004): the 10-year cancer specific survival
               rates were higher among 40-59 years of age patients (88.5\%),
               lower among 0-39 (75.8\%). Luminal A breast cancer patients had
               a constant low risk throughout 10 years of follow up, while
               luminal B/HER2 + and triple negative tumours showed a peak 5
               years after the diagnosis and then declined. DISCUSSION: Our

               showed to influence the outcome, other than stage at diagnosis

               with little evidence from clinical trials supporting the use of
               chemotherapy for elderly patients. The effectiveness of
               chemotherapy for the elderly suffering from breast cancer
               remains to be further verified. METHODS: A total of 75,525
               female breast cancer patients aged 70 years or older were hereby
               identified, all from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
               Results (SEER) database from January 1, 2010 to December 31,
               2016. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional
               model were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of
               chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific
               survival (BCSS). Propensity score matching (PSM) (PSM ratio:
               1:1, caliper: 0.2 standard deviation of propensity score) was
               applied to construct balanced cohorts with or without
               chemotherapy based on demographic and pathophysiological
               characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 33,177 eligible patients
               were included, with 5273 (15.89\%) receiving chemotherapy.
               Through PSM, 8360 patients were successfully matched, and
               balances between groups were almost reached. In the matched data
               set, multivariable Cox analysis reveals that chemotherapy was
               associated with a 36\% and 21\% risk reduction on OS (HR = 0.64,
               95\% CI 0.58 to 0.71) and BCSS (HR = 0.79, 95\% CI 0.69 to
               0.91), respectively. Furthermore, subgroups with more adjacent
               lymph nodes involved by tumor, or nonluminal A, were inclined to
               benefit more from chemotherapy. Moreover, chemotherapy did not
               increase the chances of dying from heart disease. CONCLUSIONS:
               The present study provided evidence that chemotherapy may
               improve the prognosis of elderly breast cancer, especially for
               those subpopulations that benefit more from chemotherapy

  abstract  = "Aim: Since the implementation of International Financial
               Reporting Standards 9 (IFRS 9), several techniques on estimating
               the risk parameters for calculating the expected credit losses
               (ECL) have been implemented across financial institutions. The
               purpose of this study was to present the advantages of using
               survival analysis for the estimation of the probability of
               default (PD) given the particularity of the method, within the
               estimation of the time up to an event occurring. Methodology:
               The Cox Proportional Hazard Rate was selected as the model to
               predict the default incorporating the time to event and the
               macroeconomic conditions into the model. At the end of this
               research a validation was performed of the accuracy of the
               survival method through the time. Results: The ROC curve and
               concordance statistics were evaluated on different time points,
               the survival model shows a consistent high discriminatory power
               in terms of the AUC over each time horizon. The results revealed
               that time dependent ROC curves for the selected years from 1 to
               4 and the first year have the largest area under the curve
               (AUC). The time dependent curve is evaluated at all event times
               under the 95\% pointwise confidence limits of the fitted model,
               the AUC was on average around 0.8, with the highest values in
               the first years. Implications and recommendations: The results
               are promising for PD estimation in a lifetime perspective. This
               method is accurate for IFRS9 ECL purposes as time varying
               internal (portfolio characteristics) and external
               (macroeconomic) factors can be incorporated. The dynamic model
               incorporates the variability and changes of the variables from
               the past up to now. Originality/value: To date the survival
               analysis techniques were used mostly for PD estimations but not
               in a IFRS9 ECL perspective. Given the nature of this method of
               estimating the remaining lifetime perspective and the inclusion
               into the model of the macro variables, this model can be
               considered adequate according to IFRS9. The paper aimed to
               present their uses for lifetime prediction.",

  abstract  = "In this paper, a Cox proportional hazard model with error effect
               applied on the study of an accelerated life test is
               investigated. Statistical inference under Bayesian methods by
               using the Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques is performed in
               order to estimate the parameters involved in the model and
               predict reliability in an accelerated life testing. The proposed
               model is applied to the analysis of the knock sensor failure
               time data in which some observations in the data are censored.
               The failure times at a constant stress level are assumed to be
               from a Weibull distribution. The analysis of the failure time
               data from an accelerated life test is used for the posterior
               estimation of parameters and prediction of the reliability
               function as well as the comparisons with the classical results

  abstract  = "COVID-19 vaccination is vital in reducing illness,
               hospitalization, and mortality in the face of this global
               pandemic. However, COVID-19 vaccination rates worldwide remain
               below WHO public health targets, and persistent structural
               inequities reduce vaccine uptake likelihood among populations of
               low socioeconomic status. We conducted a cross-sectional study
               based on publicly available data from the Our World in Data
               project. We included all 124 countries with available open
               epidemic data and a population of more than 5 million. We used a
               Cox Regression Model, with population, population density,
               median age, human development index, GDP per capita, gender
               inequality index, healthcare access and quality index, hospital
               beds per thousand people, completion rate of primary education,
               infection cases of COVID-19 by the end of 2022, and death rate
               due to COVID-19 by the end of 2022 as predictors for model
               hazard rates of completion of 50\% population vaccination.
               According to our study, countries with higher populations,
               higher population density, higher human development index, lower
               gender inequality index, and lower hospital beds per 1000 people
               had a higher hazard rate, which means they were more likely to
               achieve 50\% population vaccination faster. By utilizing the
               time to achieve vaccination rate goals as our primary endpoint,
               we evaluated inequity from a dual perspective, considering both
               the differences in vaccination rates and the duration required
               to attain them. Consequently, this study employed survival
               analysis approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of
               vaccine drivers and population-level trends nationally and
               inform all communities from a statistical perspective to prepare
               for health emergencies. Development-level standing modified the
               effects of equal access to COVID-19 vaccination on cumulative
               cases and mortality, for which countries of low or medium human
               development tended to fare worse in outcomes than high human
               development countries. As COVID-19 vaccination efforts evolve,
               healthcare professionals, scholars, and policymakers need to
               identify the structural impediments to equitable vaccination
               awareness, access, and uptake so that future vaccination
               campaigns are not impeded by these barriers to immunization.
               Recognizing the complex nature of this significant barrier, it
               is evident that no single statistical analysis method can
               comprehensively address all intricacies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current ESC guidelines on the management of
              patients after acute myocardial infarction only include the
              evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function by assessment of the
              ejection fraction in addition to clinical risk scores to estimate
              the patient's prognosis. We aimed to determine, whether
              comprehensive evaluation of cardiac function using LV and right
              ventricular (RV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) and left atrial
              (LA) reservoir strain improves the prediction of survival in
              patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: In patients
              with non-ST segment elevation or ST segment elevation myocardial
              infarction receiving echocardiography within 1 year after
              revascularisation, LV-GLS, RV-GLS and LA reservoir strain were
              quantified. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, HRs and
              95\% CIs were calculated per 1 SD increase in strain measure,
              adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, low-density
              lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes and family history of
              premature coronary artery disease. RESULTS: During a median
              follow-up of 1.5 (0.5-4.2) years, 157 (11.1\%) out of 1409
              patients (64.4$\pm$13.5 years, 24.7\% female) died. LV-GLS (1.68
              (1.37-2.06), p<0.001), RV-GLS (1.39 (1.16-1.67), p<0.001) and LA
              reservoir strain (0.57 (0.47-0.69), p<0.001) were associated with
              mortality. Adding LV ejection fraction, tricuspid annular plane
              systolic excursion (TAPSE) or LA volume index to these models did
              not alter the association of strain measures of the LV (1.41
              (1.06-1.89), p=0.02), RV (1.48 (1.03-2.13), p=0.04) or LA (0.61
              (0.49-0.76), p<0.001). In receiver operating characteristics,
              combining the three strain measures improved the prediction of
              mortality above risk factors (AUC: 0.67 (0.63-0.71) to 0.75
              (0.70-0.80)), while further addition of LV ejection fraction,
              TAPSE and LA volume index did not (0.75 (0.70-0.81)). CONCLUSION:
              The comprehensive evaluation of contractility of various cardiac
              chambers via transthoracic echocardiography using myocardial
              strain analysis, when routinely performed after acute myocardial
              infarction, may help to detect patients at increased mortality

               that either was locally invasive (Stage B2) or had regional

               observation or to treatment for one year with levamisole
               combined with fluorouracil. Patients with Stage C disease could
               also be randomly assigned to treatment with levamisole alone.
               The median follow-up time at this writing is 3 years (range, 2
               to 5 1/2). Among the patients with Stage C disease, therapy with
               levamisole plus fluorouracil reduced the risk of cancer
               recurrence by 41 percent (P less than 0.0001). The overall death
               rate was reduced by 33 percent (P approximately 0.006).
               Treatment with levamisole alone had no detectable effect. The
               results in the patients with Stage B2 disease were equivocal and
               too preliminary to allow firm conclusions. Toxic effects of
               levamisole alone were infrequent, usually consisting of mild
               nausea with occasional dermatitis or leukopenia, and those of
               levamisole plus fluorouracil were essentially the same as those
               of fluorouracil alone--i.e., nausea, vomiting, stomatitis,
               diarrhea, dermatitis, and leukopenia. These reactions were
               usually not severe and did not greatly impede patients'
               compliance with their regimen. We conclude that adjuvant therapy
               with levamisole and fluorouracil should be standard treatment
               for Stage C colon carcinoma. Since most patients in our study
               were treated by community oncologists, this approach should be
               readily adaptable to conventional medical practice.",
